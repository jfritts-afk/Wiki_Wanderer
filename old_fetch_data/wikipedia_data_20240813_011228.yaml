      extract: A triangle is a polygon with three corners and three sides, one of
        the basic shapes in geometry. The corners, also called vertices, are zero-dimensional
        points while the sides connecting them, also called edges, are one-dimensional
        line segments. A triangle has three internal angles, each one bounded by a
        pair of adjacent edges; the sum of angles of a triangle always equals a straight
        angle. The triangle is a plane figure and its interior is a planar region.
        Sometimes an arbitrary edge is chosen to be the base, in which case the opposite
        vertex is called the apex; the shortest segment between base and apex is the
        height. The area of a triangle equals one half the product of height and base
        length.

        was formed on 8 August 2024, following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh
        Hasina 3 days prior in the face of the student protests against the government.

      extract: Manila, officially the City of Manila, is the capital and second-most
        populous city of the Philippines, after Quezon City. Located on the eastern
        shore of Manila Bay on the island of Luzon, it is classified as a highly urbanized
        city. As of 2019, it is the world's most densely populated city proper. Manila
        was the first chartered city in the country, designated by Philippine Commission
        Act No. 183 on July 31, 1901. It became autonomous with the passage of Republic
        Act No. 409, "The Revised Charter of the City of Manila", on June 18, 1949.
        Manila is considered to be part of the world's original set of global cities
        because its commercial networks were the first to extend across the Pacific
        Ocean and connect Asia with the Spanish Americas through the galleon trade.
        This marked the first time an uninterrupted chain of trade routes circling
        the planet had been established.

      extract: Wilhelm Richard Wagner was a German composer, theatre director, polemicist,
        and conductor who is chiefly known for his operas. Unlike most opera composers,
        Wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works.
        Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic
        vein of Carl Maria von Weber and Giacomo Meyerbeer, Wagner revolutionised
        opera through his concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk, by which he sought to synthesise
        the poetic, visual, musical and dramatic arts, with music subsidiary to drama.
        He described this vision in a series of essays published between 1849 and
        1852. Wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the four-opera
        cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen.

      extract: Francesca Gaetana Cosima Wagner was the daughter of the Hungarian composer
        and pianist Franz Liszt and Franco-German romantic author Marie d'Agoult.
        She became the second wife of the German composer Richard Wagner, and with
        him founded the Bayreuth Festival as a showcase for his stage works; after
        his death she devoted the rest of her life to the promotion of his music and
        philosophy. Commentators have recognised Cosima as the principal inspiration
        for Wagner's later works, particularly Parsifal.

      extract: The Siege of Havana was a successful British siege against Spanish-ruled
        Havana that lasted from March to August 1762, as part of the Seven Years'
        War. After Spain abandoned its former policy of neutrality by signing the
        family compact with France, resulting in a British declaration of war on Spain
        in January 1762, the British government decided to mount an attack on the
        important Spanish fortress and naval base of Havana, with the intention of
        weakening the Spanish presence in the Caribbean and improving the security
        of its own North American colonies. A strong British naval force consisting
        of squadrons from Britain and the West Indies, and the military force of British
        and American troops it convoyed, were able to approach Havana from a direction
        that neither the Spanish governor nor the Admiral expected and were able to
        trap the Spanish fleet in the Havana harbour and land its troops with relatively
        little resistance.

      extract: The War of the Spanish Succession was a European great power conflict
        fought between 1701 and 1714. The immediate cause was the death of the childless
        Charles II of Spain in November 1700, which led to a struggle for control
        of the Spanish Empire among supporters of the claimant Bourbon and Habsburg
        dynasties. His official heir was Philip of Anjou, a grandson of Louis XIV
        of France, whose main backers were France and most of Spain. His rival, Archduke
        Charles of Austria, was supported by the Grand Alliance, whose primary members
        included Austria, the Dutch Republic, and Great Britain. Significant related
        conflicts include the 1700 to 1721 Great Northern War, and Queen Anne's War
        in North America.

      extract: Tiberius II Constantine was Eastern Roman emperor from 574 to 582.
        Tiberius rose to power in 574 when Justin II, prior to a mental breakdown,
        proclaimed him caesar and adopted him as his own son. In 578, the dying Justin
        II gave him the title of augustus, thus becoming co-emperor alongside him.
        Tiberius became sole ruler less than two weeks later, assuming the regnal
        name of "Constantine" under which he reigned until his death.
